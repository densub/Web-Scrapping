# Web-Scrapping

This is an ongoing project to test websites in bulk for big/medium/small organization with multiple entry points.
This project is build on tsc, puppeteer and jest and will be up and running at EC2 intance.


The Goal of this project is to create an automated scheduler to notify end users about the websites which they are subscribed to under certain behaviour or circumstances
For example:

- Website is Down
- Calculating Website Performance and trigger notification when delayed responses
- When behaviour is changed

Also going to be a great project for those lurkers who are interested in buying things(tickets, sales ...), when prices changes, when datas are created, updated or deleted


Currently on a verge of exploring options for this and adding featuures
